				Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to maneuver a ball 
				or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. There are many types of hockey

				 Basketball is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court. 
				 While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, 
				 three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. 
				 The objective is to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) 
				 through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard 
				 at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.

			<p>
				 Football is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball.
				 It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the 
				 world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. 
				 The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.
				 Players are not allowed to touch the ball with outstretched hands or arms while it is in play, 
				 unless they are goalkeepers within their penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike 
				 or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms.
